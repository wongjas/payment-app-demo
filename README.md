### GET `/api/transaction/<transaction_id>`
Get details of a specific transaction

## 🎯 Features in Detail

### Frontend Features
- **Auto-formatting**: Card numbers, expiry dates, and CVV are automatically formatted as you type
- **Visual Feedback**: Smooth animations and hover effects throughout
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for validation failures
- **Success Confirmation**: Beautiful success screen with transaction details
- **Test Cards**: One-click auto-fill for quick testing

### Backend Features
- **RESTful API**: Clean API endpoints for payment processing
- **Validation**: Basic validation of required fields
- **Random Failure**: 10% chance of payment failure to simulate real-world scenarios
- **Transaction IDs**: Generates unique transaction IDs
- **In-Memory Storage**: Stores transactions for the session

## 🎨 Customization

### Change Colors
Edit the CSS variables in `static/styles.css`:
```css
:root {
    --primary: #667eea;
    --secondary: #764ba2;
    --success: #10B981;
    --error: #EF4444;
}
```

### Change Port
Edit `app.py` and change the port number:
```python
app.run(debug=True, port=5000)  # Change 5000 to your desired port
```

### Adjust Failure Rate
Edit `app.py` and change the failure probability:
```python
if random.random() < 0.1:  # Change 0.1 to desired probability (0.0-1.0)
```

## 🛠️ Development

### Running in Debug Mode
The app runs in debug mode by default, which includes:
- Auto-reload on file changes
- Detailed error messages
- CORS enabled for API testing

### Adding Features
Some ideas for enhancement:
- Add more payment methods (PayPal, Apple Pay, etc.)
- Implement payment history dashboard
- Add refund functionality
- Create admin panel
- Add email receipt generation
- Implement webhooks for payment events

## 📝 Notes

- Payments are stored in memory and will be lost when the server restarts
- The app simulates a 1-second processing delay for realism
- 10% of payments randomly fail to demonstrate error handling
- All card numbers are accepted (no real validation)
